Map Generator for Seven Kingdoms: Ancient Adversaries
-----------------------------------------------------

Version: Proof of concept
License: GPLv3
Based on 7kaa release 2.14.4 (project website: www.7kfans.com)


This is a map generator for 7kaa, allowing you to generate random maps
and get a preview of how it will look. If you like the map, you can copy
the random seed value that created this map and use it in 7kaa to start
a game on your chosen map.

The current version is nothing more than a proof of concept. As such, it
is not yet functional as a map geneator. Next step is to actually make it
interactive so you can cycle through maps, view the seed value and select
options that affect map generation.

7kmapgen was created by hijacking 7kaa and reusing almost all of the code.
Only minor changes to the original codebase have occurred, mostly wrecking
out Window & SDL stuff to prevent 7kaa from actually drawing.


A project file for Microsoft Visual Studio C++ 2010 is supplied with the
project, and currently this is the only supported build method.
NOTE: The makefiles are still those of 7kaa, and thus are not up-to-date /
capable of building 7kmapgen.

To build this version you'll need ENet, SDL2 and OpenAL32, just like 7kaa.
For steps on how to set up your build environment, I refer you to the README
file of my fork of the 7kaa project:
    https://github.com/MicroVirus/7kaa

Note that 7kmapgen does not provide the OpenAL32 library files, but you can
directly copy this from my fork.
